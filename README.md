# Automatic Cyberroam Login
To make this run in your laptop, you will have to know basics of Python and will have to make few changes according to your Laptop. 
The comments of the code have detailed explanations for you to proceed and make it work in your laptop too.

Also, do not move,type or change the mouse or keyboard while the program is running. Doing so will obviously cause errors.

I use Ubuntu, so it never says "Its unsafe, do you want to proceed?" or "You do not have the certificate.", such things on the browser. If there are any such things for you, we can solve it just by adding a few more lines.

For me the code is running good and is saving me time and effort :)
